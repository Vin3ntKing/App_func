# USCensus Flutter App

This Flutter application is being developed as part of my USCensus project. The goal of this project is to create a mobile app that provides access to various census data and statistics.

## Inspiration

The login user interface (UI) for this app is inspired by Mitch Koko's work. Mitch Koko is known for his exceptional design skills and has created beautiful UIs for mobile applications. I found inspiration in his work and have incorporated some of his design elements into the login screen of this app.

## Features

- User authentication: The app allows users to sign up, log in, and securely access their account.
- Census data: Users can explore various census data and statistics, such as population demographics, economic indicators, and more.
- Visualizations: The app provides interactive visualizations and charts to present census data in a user-friendly way.
- Favorites: Users can save their favorite census data and access it quickly for future reference.
